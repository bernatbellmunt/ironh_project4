1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Morty, are you getting sick  I told you not to practice-kiss the living room pillow. The dog sleeps on it."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"I wasnt kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didnt get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something."

1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Okay, with all due respect, Rick what am I talking about What respect is due How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Listen, Jerry. I-I-I dont want to overstep my bounds or anything. Its your house. Its your world. Youre a real Julius Caesar but Ill tell you somethingtell you how I feel about school, Jerry. Its a waste of time.  Buncha people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, two plus two. The people in the back say, four. Then thethen the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, its not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know thats not a popular opinion, but its my two cents on the issue.  This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them."
1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Oh, dad"
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,What For real
1,1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,"Alright, now, everybody get settled. Get away from the windows"
1,1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,"Now, look, were gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today. You might have heard of it. Its called math And without it, none of us would even exist, so lets jump right in. Two plus two."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,Jessica.
1,1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,Five plus five.
1,1,Pilot,Morty,Jessica.
1,1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,"Okay, good. Its time for the quiz."
1,1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,"Yeah, you know what Aw, too bad Tough First row, take one. Pass it back for me. The stakes are high in this room.  Theres crucial things happening here every day. People getting smarter. Some of yall getting dumber. Some of yall aint gonna see 3"
1,1,Pilot,Jessica,"Hi, Morty."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Whoa Hi, Jessica."
1,1,Pilot,Jessica,Can I show these to you

1,1,Pilot,Jessica,You know what I named these My little Morties.
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Uh, thats flattering... and a little weird."
1,1,Pilot,Jessica,Do you know what I want you to do with them
1,1,Pilot,Morty,Rename them
1,1,Pilot,Jessica,"Squeeze them. Manhandle them. Give them the business. See if you can shuffle them. I mean, really get in there and knock them around. No wrong answers."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-lets give this a shot."
1,1,Pilot,Jessica,"Mm. Oh, Morty. What are you doing to me"
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Uh, I-Im just doing my best."

1,1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,"Five more minutes of this, and Im gonna get mad."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,Je-Jessica. Jessica.
1,1,Pilot,Mr. Goldenfold,Not my fault this is happening.
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Uh, morning, Frank."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, geez, Frank. I dont know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whatd you do to Frank"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Its pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business.  Its important. Come on, Morty."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"I dont know, Rick. I cant leave school again."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty What do you think I can just do it all by myself Come on"
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank I mean, shouldnt you unfreeze him"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Ill do it later, Morty. Hell be fine. Lets go."
1,1,Pilot,Summer,"Hi, Frank."
1,1,Pilot,Summer,AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
1,1,Pilot,Beth,Scalpel.
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Knock, knock."
1,1,Pilot,Beth,Jerry
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, hey, why not swing by where your wife works"
1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Jerry, please tell me youre here for an incredibly urgent reason."
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Well, its lunch. I mean, its one of three meals that have existed for millennia."
1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery."
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Well, yeah, on horses."
1,1,Pilot,Beth,Excuse me
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Okay, Lets not rehash that fight. I sense that youre busy and will now be on my way."
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Whoa What is this on the floor Some kind of literature for a really nice-looking nursing home. Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch lets put your dad here. Lets put your dad in a nursing home."
1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Hey, Tom We know when were losing him. WE CAN HEAR THE BEEPS"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Lets go."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, geez, okay."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, man, Rick. What is this place"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Its Dimension 35-C, and its got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a Mega Tree, and theres fruit in those trees, and theres seeds in those fruits. Im talking about Mega Seeds. Theyre theyre incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, man, Rick. Im looking around this place, and Im starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. Youre looking around, and its all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull thats how we grow as people. Im no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, were gonna be"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"HOLY CRAP, MORTY RUN"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"I never seen that thing before in my life. I dont even know what the hell it is We got to get out of here, Morty Its gonna kill us Were gonna die Were gonna die, Morty"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that Thats the smell of adventure, Morty. Thats thats the smell of-of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be Shouldnt I be back at school by now"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Are you joking me I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there.  What the hell is that thing You think youre gonna see that kind of thing at school  Look at it just lumbering around.  It defies all logic, that thing."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Yeah, Rick, I get it. Were surrounded by monsters. Thats kind of the reason why I want to leave."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty Any idea what that is down there"
1,1,Pilot,Morty,The mega trees
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Thats right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and thats what Im talking about, Morty. Thats where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because youre so in love with school."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"All right, all right. So, whats so special about these seeds, anyways"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an  under-  underfoot figure."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Just take these shoes, Morty. Theyre  special grappling shoes. When youre wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,AAAAAAAHHHH
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"You have to turn them on, Morty The shoes have to be turned on"
1,1,Pilot,Beth,"I am not putting my father in a home He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last months Victorias Secret"
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"I told you I was ordering you something for Valentines Day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son."
1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Its fine, Davin."
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Since were fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies."
1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Look, I appreciate the stress youre under, but Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend."
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Well, maybe youre right."
1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Uh, yeah, maybe I am. Im my fathers daughter. Im smart. Why do you think Im a heart surgeon"
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Ahem, Horse heart surgeon."
1,1,Pilot,Principal Vagina,"Hello Mrs. Smith This is Principal Vagina, no relation. I wonder if you and Mortys father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on  your legs right now. You know, you got to turn  the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Im in a lot of pain, Rick"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Yeah, I can see that. But do you think youll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty"
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Are you kidding me Thats it, Rick Thats the last straw I cant believe this Im sitting here with both of my legs broken, and youre still asking me about getting those seeds Ooh Ow Oh Y-y-youre a monster. Y-youre like Hitler, but-but even Hitler cared about Germany or something."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Okay, hold on just a second, Morty."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,Ooh Ohh Ooh Hnngh Hoo Ooh Ohh Aaaaagh Oooooh
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Ooh, Ohh, Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, Ive never felt so good in my life. Thank you."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Dont worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy"
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Sure thing, Rick."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.  The stuff was all over the place, Morty."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Wow, thats pretty crazy, Rick."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Theres just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that  they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty.  It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they-they-they they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device its got no charge left, Morty. Its got no charge left."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,What
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Its as good as garbage, Morty. Its not gonna work anymore, Morty."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, geez, Rick, thats not good. W-what are we gonna do I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Theres ways to get back home, Morty. Its just its just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. Were gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so youre gonna have to do me a real solid."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,Uh-oh.
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"When we get to customs, Im gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and Im gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,In my butt
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, geez, Rick. I really dont want to have to do that."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Well, somebodys got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds arent gonna get through customs unless theyre in someones rectum, Morty"
1,1,Pilot,Morty,Uuuh.
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"And theyll fall right out of mine. Ive done this too many times, Morty. I mean, youre young. Y-y-youve got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y-  youve got to put these seeds inside your butt."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,In my butt
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, man."
1,1,Pilot,Principal Vagina,"The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months."
1,1,Pilot,Beth,What Why didnt you notify us
1,1,Pilot,Principal Vagina,I done been notifying you. Have you not been getting the messages Ive been leaving with Mortys grandfather
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Boom Told you In your face He is ruining our child Wait, what am I celebrating"
1,1,Pilot,Principal Vagina,"Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because its usually Mortys grandpa thats taking him out of school."
1,1,Pilot,Beth,Summer
1,1,Pilot,Summer,What kind of God lets this happen
1,1,Pilot,Principal Vagina,We had a little incident. A student was frozen to death.  And theres no evidence that a Latino student did it Everyone wants to take this to a racial place. I wont let them.
1,1,Pilot,Announcer,The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
1,1,Pilot,Announcer,The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"I dont like it here, Morty. I cant abide bureaucracy. I dont like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt"
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Yeah, Rick. Lets just get this over with, okay I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"That means theyre good ones. Youre a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. Youve been a huge help to me. Im gonna be able to do a-"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,Why does he have to go over there
1,1,Pilot,Rick,What new-  what new machine
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Run, Morty Run"
1,1,Pilot,Morty,Aaaaaah
1,1,Pilot,Morty,Ohhhhh
1,1,Pilot,Morty,Ohhhhhh
1,1,Pilot,Morty,Aaaaah
1,1,Pilot,Rick,Dont think about it
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Ooh Oh, nice, Morty The student becomes the teacher."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,Whoooooo
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I dont want to shoot nobody."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Theyre just robots, Morty Its okay to shoot them Theyre robots"
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Theyre not robots, Rick"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Its a figure of speech, Morty. Theyre bureaucrats. I dont respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here"
1,1,Pilot,Morty,Holy crap This is insane
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Come on, Morty We got to get the hell out of here"
1,1,Pilot,Jessica,Wow. Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my-my Ferraris in the shop.  Just kidding."
1,1,Pilot,Jessica,"Youre Morty, right"
1,1,Pilot,Morty,Yeah.
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass."
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Oh, look, honey. Its our son with Albert Ein-douche."
1,1,Pilot,Beth,What
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Im an angry father, not an improviser."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty What are you doing out of class We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in-in this behavior... No No takers"
1,1,Pilot,Rick,You guys should really not be touching that stuff. Its beyond your reasoning.
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,Youre beyond our reasoning
1,1,Pilot,Rick,Takes one to know one.
1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school I mean, its not like hes a hot girl. He cant just bail on his life and set up shop in someone elses."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,What what are you guys doing with my stuff
1,1,Pilot,Beth,Were moving you to a nursing home.
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"A nursing home What are what are you, nuts Im a genius. I build robots for fun."
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and mentally scar the Boy Scouts every Christmas."
1,1,Pilot,Beth,What does that mean
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,Its personal.
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all."
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,What are you trying to say about Morty That hes stupid or something
1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Oh, dont high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,I-I-I dont know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Oh, for crying outhes got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say"
1,1,Pilot,Morty,I do
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know youre not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, thats a lot to drop on a kid all at once."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Oh, come on, Rick. You know I cant."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"The square root of Pi, Morty. Go"
1,1,Pilot,Morty,1.77245385... Whoa
1,1,Pilot,Beth,What the hell
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,Holy crap. Hes right.
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system. Wow Im so smart
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,But
1,1,Pilot,Rick,I told the both of you school is stupid. Its not how you learn things. Mortys a gifted child. He has a special mind. Thats why hes my little helper. Hes like me. Hes gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. Hes too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.
1,1,Pilot,Beth,"Jerry, I dont want whatevers happening here to stop."
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do Say no You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, its gonna be clear communication."
1,1,Pilot,Summer,Frank Palicky was frozen to death today
1,1,Pilot,Rick,No idea what youre talking about.
1,1,Pilot,Jerry,"Okay. Well, uh, Morty, its your bedtime in an hour. Dont stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family and now, Beth, if youll have me, I would love to have you."
1,1,Pilot,Beth,You know what Okay.
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Holy cow, Rick. I didnt know hanging out with you was making me smarter."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Full disclosure, Morty its not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Aw, man."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, youre gonna lose most of your motor skills, and youre also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty."
1,1,Pilot,Morty,"Ohh, man.  Oh, geez Ohh."
1,1,Pilot,Rick,"Im sorry, Morty. Its a bummer. In reality, youre as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now were gonna have to go get more adventures.  And then were gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and youre gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that dont understand whats important, and theyll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, Im gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and youre gonna be part of them, and together, were gonna run around, Morty. Were gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. Were the only friends weve got, Morty. Its just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Mortys things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. All 100 years. Every minute, rickandmorty.com."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,What Why are you looking at me You want to go outside Outside
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Outside
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Are you kidding me Come on
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Oh, my God."

1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Oh, he he didnt mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles Youre a good boy."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Dont praise him now, Morty He just peed on the carpet Bad dog Bad"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Morty, come on. I need your help tonight."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick. You wouldnt by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldnt pull that thread. Come on, Morty."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Listen, Rick, if youre gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Mortys grounded"

1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Goldenfold, were coming out We just want to talk"

1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Oh, no, Rick, look Goldenfold landed the plane, and hes created a  mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like weve merely prolonged the inevitable. Thats it, Morty Prolonging the inevitable Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. Thatll buy us some time to figure this out"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mrs. Pancakes,You dont know m-

1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. Ill just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If were gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. Ill talk to you after lunch."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Ooh, oh Oh, man."

1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Can you blame him Come on, old man, little boy. Lets make an inter-generational sandwich."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Time to go another dream deep, Morty"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,What the hell Why would Mr. Goldenfolds dream version of Mrs.

1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Oh, here we go"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,Ooooooohhhhh Holy crap

1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Im scary Terry. You can run, but you cant hide, bitch"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Whoa Hey, buddy. What you got going on there"

1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Funs over."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Whoa, dad, you cant, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Why not
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,I dont know. Its Indian giving.
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Aw Oh, my God He recognizes the other dogs on TV."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Holy crap We have to escape into someone elses dreams, Morty"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,The little girl

1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Do not call me that
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"Snuffles was my slave name. You shall now call me Snowball, because my fur is pretty and white."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay Youre scaring me."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Scaring you

1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,Yeah. Totally. Lets go.
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,You will walk when it is time to walk.
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,What are we here for again Incepting Were trying to incept-
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,Were trying to incept me to get an A in math

1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Man, he sure says bitch a lot"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"You can run, but you cant hide, bitch"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,But thats the opposite of what-
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guys advice on anything"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Hey, you know what You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, its not like hed be sharing that information with us, you know I-I-I think its a good idea, Rick."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,Worst-case scenario were back to running.
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Wow, you know what I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Thanks, Morty. Yeah, its nice to be on the same page every once in a while."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,You can run But you cant hide
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. Hes getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. Thats when we make our move."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Snuffles, we didnt mean you any harm This is a huge misunderstanding."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,"Dad, he wants to be called snowball."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Well, Im not calling him that. Thats ridiculous."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"Youre being very aggressive, Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Huh You think you can control me with a haircut
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,I dont want to talk about it
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Yeah, I know, I know. I shouldnt take my anger out on you or Scary Brandon. I love you, Melissa."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then well incept him."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,Looks like scary Terrys having a nightmare.
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare Scary Terry."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Oh, no Im late to class, bitch Oh, no Im not wearing any pants"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Oh, uh, um ... Bitch."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone Why dont you let the poor guy say whatever he wants"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Youre putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-youre perfectly scary enough as it is."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Hey, yo, scary T., dont even trip about your pants dawg. Heres a pair on us, fool."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Aww, bitch. I dont know what to say."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"You dont need to say anything. We got you, dawg."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Youre our boy, dawg. Dont even trip."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"Oh, hey, its you guys"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"If you guys ever need anything, just say the word."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,I always hated that song
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"These halves dont belong together, bitch"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,Sex is sacred
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Scary Terry,"This is because you dont give Morty Smith good grades, bitch"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Mr. Goldenfold,"Holy crap God damn I know one thing for sure Im giving Morty an A in math, and thats my idea. That is an original thought."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,What the hell
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Oh, man, whats going on"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Well, its possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanitys cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,I cant believe how mean snuffles got just because hes smart.
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Summer,This is why I choose to get Cs.
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,- Dad - Rick
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Were not going anywhere. This is my house. Im not abandoning it."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Its all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,"Wait a minute. I have an idea. Gentlemen, a moment of your time.  See that Im peeing all over your special guns. That means I own them."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Bad person. Bad.
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Ooh, great plan, Jerry."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"Bring the boy to me. You were always kind to me, Morty. Thats why I will leave you with your testicles. From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Th-thanks, snuffles."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Begin phase two.
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Mmm. Thank you, Fido. Rick I thought you were dead"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole things gonna be over really soon."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,What
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Its a dream, Morty. Were in your dogs dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles dream."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,But I-its been like a whole year
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Its been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. Its like Inception, Morty, so if its confusing and stupid, then so is everyones favorite movie."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didnt really crap my pants."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. Youre sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, its a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Aw, man, geez Seriously"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Look, d-d-d-dont worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,Close. Its gonna make your kidneys shut down.
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,What
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Its necessary for the plan, Morty. Dont even trip, dawg."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,Anything. Anything for my precious Morty.
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"To hell with my kingdom, bean counter. I would trade it all for my humans health and happiness."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,We are not them We are not them.
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"Taking over the humans world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty. Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Im gonna miss you, snowball."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Snuffles,"You can call me snuffles, Morty, and Im going to miss you, too, very much."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Beth,Jerry
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Jerry,Im sorry. Its just like the end of Old Yeller.
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Beth,"Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"Wow A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what itll be like, Rick."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, Id watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe theyll do it board-driven."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Morty,"You know, thats a real comforting idea, Rick."
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"What do you know, Morty What do you know"
1,2,Lawnmower Dog,Rick,"Oooh This is how you dream, bitch."
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Principal Vagina,"Principal Vagina here, dont let the name fool you, Im very much in charge, reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I dont know how many times I have to say this but if you have the flu, stay home, the flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You dont bring dead babies to Passover."
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"Ohhh. Okay, here we go.    H-Heyy Jessica, ughh."

1,6,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,"Eh, Try not to worry about it, Morty. Youre a good kid, and theres not a premium on that right now, but youll be getting girls sometime after Brads out of shape."
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"Youre missing the point, Dad. I dont want girls, I want Jessica"
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,"Ahhh, well,  I remember feeling that way about a young lady named your mom, and thats not an urban dis, your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her, I thought..."
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"I should get her pregnant, then shell have to marry me."
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,"I beg your pardon, Rick, INAPPROPRIATE."
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school.  Im not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty, his marriage is hanging from a thread."
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,"My marriage is fine, thank you."
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"Jerry, its your house, whatever you say it is is how it is,  but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed."
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"Come on, Rick, dont talk about my parents like that."
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call love is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science."
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"Alright, well, Im gonna go get dressed for the dance."
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,"Yeah, Im just going to...check on your mom."

1,6,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"Morty, thats such a poor use of my time, its beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver."
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Morty,"YOU KNOW WHAT, NO RICK IM NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER Uh, Im never gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick.  Im always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, Rick Www... why cant you just help me out once, once, for once"
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"Youre growing up fast, Morty. Youre growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass  Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is"
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Rick,"Its a, its a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical release in the mammals brain,  ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Morty, I just gotta  combine it with some of your DNA."

1,6,Rick Potion 9,Beth,"Loving you is work, Jerry, hard work, like building a homeless shelter. Nobody want to say no to doing it, but some people put the work in. So what do ya say Do you see me working here Does this conversation seem tedious to me"
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Jerry,Sort of.
1,6,Rick Potion 9,Beth,"But I obviously sort of love you, dont I  So stop asking and maybe Ill love you more.  Crap, They need me at the horse hospital."

1,6,Rick Potion 9,Summer,"Yeah, Dad, digging around the inside of horses. Its not a very romantic setting."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"Hurry up Morty, Grampas about to unfreeze time. You know you really should be cleaning from top to bottom."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, Ive been doing it for six months"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"Then youve been doing it wrong for six months. Oh, my God, is that mildew"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,Its not my fault we froze time on a humid day
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"You have dropped so many balls, man. Do you ever get scared Grampa Rick might make me his new sidekick"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,What What kind of monster are you
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer,A competent one.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,Who cares about the  thing you guys are talking about The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and lets get this dumb universe rolling. Lets do this thing.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the worlds time is gonna be fine, but our times gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,Our time is gonna be unstable What does that even mean
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means dont touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"Wait a minute, what"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,And away we go
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Shhh, Morty"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"...A THING OR TWO ABOUT... wait, what Was the house... When we pulled up I could have sworn the house was completely trashed."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where youre at. Hi, sweety."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Hi, dad."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Summer, Morty, are you okay"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,W-We just missed you a lot.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why dowhy dowhywhy dont you guys go get a free sunday ice cream,  go out there and get some ice creams. Heres five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. Im just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream wont save you. Ill get my jacket."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Sweety, is your shirt on backwards"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,Oh
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,Uh oh.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"Yeah, I like it this way. Im not stupid."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,Phew...
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows whats going on.  Oh you agree, huh  You like that Red Grin Grumble reference  Well guess what I made him up. You really are your fathers children. Think for yourselves, dont be sheep."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"God, I feel terrible."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be.   One minute youre falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"Uh, just to be clear, it was Summers job to put the mattress under-"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"Uh, what It was your job, Morty."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,Nuh uh
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer,Yeah huh
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the banks money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"Boom In your face Summer You really dropped the ball, man."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"Shut up Morty, you vindictive little turd"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,You shut up you big... female asshole
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer,I didnt
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,You didnt what
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,Whats yours
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,You shut up
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Oh God, oh no, what did you guys just do"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer 1,What do you mean
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,"Wait, what am I saying"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,Oh man... I dont feel good.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty 1,Am I me I think so.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,A-am I talking right now
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,"Wait, who said that"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Alright both of you, just dont move, dont speak, dont think. I have to check something."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer 1,What should we do Morty
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty 1,Lets see if he needs help.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,What do you mean youre gonna help him.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer 1,"Ugh, I can help too."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,Whats happening Grampa
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,Shut up  Oh crap are you kidding me Two dots This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty 1,What do you mean
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,What In English
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer 1,What English please
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,Our time is fractured. You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty thats split our reality into two equally possible impossiblities. W-were exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. Were entirely hypothetical.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,But I thought there were infinite timelines.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Were not on any timeline, dummy. Look."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,"Oh, my God"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,Are those cats
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"I assume theyre Schrodingers cats. A-actually, I assume they both are and arent, just like us."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,Mom and Dad Get your head out of your familys ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion. Your parents get to exist. Theyre probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their shitty marriage.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,Cold Stone Creamery is the best. What should we do with our remaining twenty dollars
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,You realize they sing no matter how much you tip.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,Holy shit What happened
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,I hit a deer W-we have to tell the cops you were driving.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,W-what
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,This is Rum Raisin
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,Its still alive.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"Well, do we- do I uh, get a big rock Or--"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Its not an armadillo, asshole"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"I thought thats what a mans supposed to say, its not like I could have actually done it."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but I-I think we have to just-"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"Its okay, this is just something that happens. And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do, youre a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,So...
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,Well dont different animals-
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,Require different levels of skill to keep alive
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,Oh God...
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Get the deer in the car, Jerry."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,Yes Beth.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"This is why you dont freeze time, you guys. Its incredibly irresponsible.Morty 1"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,And you did it so you could clean the house after a party
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Look, theres no time to hold me accountable, Morty. Like literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually everything either is or isnt. And weve got about four hours to be is."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty 1,Or...
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,Or
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,We isnt
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Alright, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since its impossible that I didnt nail this, Im probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Whatever youre asking, the answer is Im amazing. And away we go"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Huh, what do you know, its working"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer 1,"Ow, ow ouch"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,"Whoa, ow, ow."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,Oh shit.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,What the hell is wrong with you two II mI mI mean you four
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Good Im glad it was painful. You do deserve it I saw you, youre both  all over the damn place. Weve been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum fucking wind What the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about Your brand of zit cream Which chair to sit in while I do everything Come on, spit it out"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,"Well you dont exactly make it easy, Rick"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty 1,You make fun of me all the time and now Summers doing it too
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,Youre always picking on me and now you got someone to kiss your ass
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer 1,Me What about you Would you get more excited to see me fail You want Grampa all to yourself
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Alright, cool it, I see whats happening here. Youre both young, youre both unsure about your place in the universe, you both wanna be Grampas favorite. I can fix this. Morty sit here, Summer, you sit here. Now listen, I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grampas concerned, youre both pieces of shit. Yeah, I can prove it mathematically. Actually, let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming anyway."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Emergency, wounded deer coming in."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Vet,"Three. Excuse me, you cant be back here."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Im a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention. Nurse, please move that snake."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Vet,"Thats my nurse, and as a horse surgeon, Im sure that you know that deer have much smaller, much more intricate organs-"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"As a vet, Im sure you know a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor, so lets save the measuring for when our dicks are out, its time to save a life"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Vet,Geez...
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Thats odd, this deers wounded."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"Uh, yeah, I was there, you dont have to rub it in."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,I mean its been shot. With a gun.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Vet,"May I help you, sir"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Vet,"Look, I dont know what the law says about this, but I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm. Except when sterilizing, aborting or euthenizing them and also when eating them at almost any meal."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"In your dreams, bitch Scalpel"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"So in conclusion, youre both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi. And I honestly cant tell the two of you half the time because I dont go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. Alright, everything resolved Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Alright, perfect. Sit still,  arms down, Im gonna do this again, this time, be like Grampa."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,You mean drunk
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,No.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Huh, thats weird. Oh, my God."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,What
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,That son of a bitch is gonna kill me
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,Rick what the hell are you doing
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,Saving our lives. After he takes me out hes gonna be coming for you
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,Who
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,Me
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,Ahh
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,Whoa whoa
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Oh God, now theres three of them, were outnumbered Get in the cupboards Wait, dont dont do that, theyll know... wait wait, think about getting in the cupboards but dont really. AAAAH IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT YOU SICK FUCKS YOU WANNA SEE CHILDREN DIE"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"You son of a bitch, you dont stop living until I SAY SO"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Vet,Whos this now
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,She normally works on horses.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Jerry, if youre not gonna help, get the fuck out of here I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Vet,Jesus...
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Shh shh... I know where you are, you creepy old monster... I know how you think Oh, is this where you think Im going You think Im standing here Well maybe youre right"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,"Holy shit, now what"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,"Well if all of me knocked out all the Ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesnt that mean that were all synchronized"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,Right.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,"Okay... so from now on, whatever we do we have to be certain."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,Right...
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,I think Im certain were Fd in the A.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Oh God, my head. What did you guys do"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,"We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,You tried to kill yourself
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Only in self defense, myself tried to kill me first Guys, I dont expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and weve got half as much time to solve it. Well actually, I do expect you to understand that, its basic math. C-could someone just let me out of here If I die in a cage I lose a bet."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,Well is there some way you can prove youre not a threat to yourself and others anymore
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Ah, for Gods sake, alright here, give me the time crystal."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,W-whatre you doing
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Calling myself. Here, listen,  itll probably go to voice mail since, you know, Im calling myself."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Dont fall for it, its a bit."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Hey Rick, its Rick. Listen, Im sorry about earlier. No hard feelings. I know you know I mean it too. Take it easy. Whoa. Damn, look at this, Im blown up. Three new voicemails.  Yeah yeah, I heard this one.  You get the idea  were cool now."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,"Okay, well were still not gonna let you out of this crate."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,Fine Ill just do it myself.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,If you could get out that whole time why didnt you
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty. Thats the difference between you and me. Im certain, and youre a walking burlap sack filled with turds."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,"You know, geez Rick, yyyoure really tearing into me right now. You know, words hurt."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty 1,"Oh, my God"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty 2,Its a monster
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer 1,Its a monster
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Ey, ye ey, quit yellin quit yellin."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"What the fuck Your time is all ripped up to hell You broke your time, twice"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,How did this happen
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Shut the fuck up Oh, damn, Im from the 4th dimension. I can hear all o yall. Now lets just see what we got here for a second."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Ay, damn it, were you tryin to use this to- oh, see, you broke time, and you thought you could just stick it back together with this How you think you gonna move time while youre standin in it you dumn ass three-dimensional monkey ass dummies"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Mortys,"Oh way to go, Rick."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Summers,"Yeah Grampa, way to go."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,All Ricks,"Oh, what youre just gonna listen to this guy now Hes got a giant testicle for a head He came here in a bubble. For all we know he could be the David Berkowitz of Nutsack Land."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Shut up. Here, put these on. Theyll sync your possibilities up so I can bring you back to certain time. Yall just-just negligent, now ay, ay, ay, the three of you, put your collars on"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Exactly, because youre being obstinate."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Yes, were back, problem solved."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"Yes, were back to our own time."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Yeah, now keep those collars on so you dont break your weak ass time again."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,How long exactly do we have to wear these things Theyre really embarassing.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Well since youre goin to time prison, Id say you can keep em on forever."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer,Time prison
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Yeah, well I dont know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there, but the only way you dumb ass, assin ass asses could ever have one, is if it was stolen."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer,You stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they dont exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, theres a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,Ututututut Youd better keep back Man this will turn your ass into a third trimester fetus from 30 yards.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Vet,Hmm...
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,Isnt there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"Honey, its gonna be okay. These men are from the Cervine Institute of Elk, Moose Deer and Stag. They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the countrys top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border, where your jurisdiction ends."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Vet,I guess thats the end of that.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,We did it...
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Uh-huh, no motha- no, Earth, dude, Im talking bout, yeah, with the dinosaurs. No, if youve get to the dolphin people, youve gone too far. Alright man, Ill talk to you later, okay.  You know what they do with 3rd dimensional life forms in time prison Same thing they do in every other prison, only forever."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,Why are you doing this
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"You think I wanna be an omniscient immortal being transcending time and space my whole life I got ambitions man, bringin you guys in is my ticket up."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,What if I told you theres a huge ticket up right behind you
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,You really think Im that stupid
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Alright, hear me out on this. Youre immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case theres 100% chance that youll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,I cannot argue that.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Ah, God, gross and weird"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,Chris
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,You killed my gun
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Summer, Morty, take off your collars"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,What What the hell are you doing
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,Good question. I suppose the answer is
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Oh, no, what are you doin"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Lis- ay, to, AH. But these arms are vestigial. Now you poked me where an eye would have been about six million years ago."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Testicle Monster A,"Ow, Im defeated..."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today. I know its my fault we hit the deer, and I know you wanted to be the one to save it."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,Whatever. How petty would I have to be to care less about an animals life than my own ego
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,Hmm... youd have to be pretty petty. But youd still be the woman I married.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,Where are we going
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,One last stop.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,Wheres the helicopter
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,There is no helicopter and there is no Cervine Institute.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,But the top deer surgeon...
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,Im looking at her. Thanks for F.D.ing me up like that.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,I need five minutes.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Jerry, this was the most romantic weekend Ive ever had."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,Thanks to Cold Stone Creamery.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"Yes, oh, yes, yes"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer,Woohoo Whoo Whoo

2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,Do the cabbage patch. Dododo the dance.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Summer,"Hey wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,I dont know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didnt work. Its hard to keep straight now that I have sixty-three other memories of everything.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,Yeah.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"But I feel like one of the sixty-four Ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,"Shut up, Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little spiece of shit."
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,"Hey guys, were home.Morty  Summer"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Jerry,"Um, hold the phone, where did you guys get those necklaces from Uh, Lady Gaga, table for three, am I right"

2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,Im gonna pee my pants.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Morty,"Doesnt feel so good, does it"
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Rick,No it doesnt. It hurts.
2,1,A Rickle in Time,Beth,Im gonna pee-hee-hee.

2,10,The Wedding Squanchers,Jerry,The trick to cereal is keeping 70% of it above the milk.
2,10,The Wedding Squanchers,Beth,"Jerry, get a job."
2,10,The Wedding Squanchers,Rick,"Uh, w-why dont you get it Jerry youre the man of the house and you dont have a job."

2,10,The Wedding Squanchers,Beth,"Oh, okay... I squanch my family."
2,10,The Wedding Squanchers,Beth,"What I do, I squanch my family."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Oh boy. Time to go, Morty."

2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"The Pentagon. I mean, not THE Pentagon.  The lame one, here on Earth."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Is it God If its God, do we get out of school"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Its not God, Summer."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"Shes allowed to think its God if she wants, honey"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Shut up, Jerry."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,Ok
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Dad, what do you know about this"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,Morty and I are going to look into it. You guys hold tight.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,"Scary stuff, huh Pretty freaky. Hi, Im Mortys math teacher. Im also part of the street team inviting folks to the church downtown so we can pray together."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,How is praying going to help

2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,My name is Rick Sanchez. This heres my grandson Morty.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,Hey.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Ive seen enough of the galaxy to know that what weve got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math.  This head wont go away until  Earth shows them its got a hit song."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms."
2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"All right, all right. Thank you, Mr. Sanchez. Change of plan, people. Get me Pharrell, Randy Newman, Billy Corgan, and The-Dream.  The-Dream He wrote Umbrella and Single Ladies You people havent heard of The-Dream"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,Youre gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Nathan,How do you know about that
2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"For Gods sake, Nathan, the man turns people into snakes. He can use Google Maps."
2,5,Get Schwifty,President,What How is that possible Do people just die when I name them
2,5,Get Schwifty,President,Dear God.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Good luck, Mr. President."
2,5,Get Schwifty,President,Sanchez Are you a musician
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"I dabble, Mr. President."
2,5,Get Schwifty,President,Get this man and his grandson on a Blackhawk to Area 51.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Hi, Principal Vagina. The names real, possibly Scandinavian. Im just gonna come out and make this pitch. The old gods are dead. Fuck all previous existing religions. All hail the one true god, the giant head in the sky."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Ah, di di di di.  Bob, Bob, I get it. But unless this  can beat that what have you done for me lately  So if you wanna excuse me, Im going out on the sidewalk and dropping to my knees and pledging my eternal soul to the thing that literally controls the fucking weather  Outta my way"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,"Ohhhh, this is my favorite part"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Rick, are you really a musician"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Whos NOT a musician, Morty"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,Me
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Yeah, not with that attitude."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,B-b-but we dont have a song
2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Giant head in the sky, please forgive all that weve done. Were sorry for increased levels of emissions and our racism. And of course, the amber alerts I keep ignoring on my phone."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"All right, Morty, lets get ready to do it Why dont you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Rick, I think we need to cut our losses. We get our family and portal out of here"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Morty Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty Gimme a beat"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Oh man, ok, all right, um"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,Ahhhhh yeahhhhh Ya gotta get schwifty  Ya gotta get schwifty in here Its time to get schwifty

2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"Its our worlds best effort, thats what."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,Take off your pants and your panties Shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here Im Mr. Bulldops
2,5,Get Schwifty,Nathan,Mr. Bulldops
2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"Dont analyze it, Nathan. Its working"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,Take a shit on the floor Time to get schwifty in here

2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Hey, take your pants off Its schwifty time today"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,Please be kind to us for we are but tiny things with entire bodies stuck to your ground.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Now hold on a second, lets be rational about this."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"No, Im Im just saying, we dont know if theres a cause-effect relationship --"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Oh, God, whats going on now"
2,5,Get Schwifty,President,What the hell happened
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,I think planet Earth has just been transported.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,The head has left and sent its children
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,Holy CRAP
2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Oh dear giant head, we apologize for that discussion It will never happen again"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,"WE ASKED THEM TO SHOW US WHAT THEY GOT. AND THEY DID. NOW WELL SEE WHICH OF THEM HAS GOT THE MOST. 24 HOURS, FIVE PLANETS, FIVE SONGS. BUT IN THE END, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. PLANET MUSIC All participation is involuntary. Disqualified and losing planets are disintegrated by plasma ray."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Uhh, its probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,"Welcome back to Planet Music First up, lets hear the latest song from planet Parblesnops. The Greebybobes SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,DISQUALIFIED
2,5,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,Theres one every season. Moving on to planet Arbolez Meterosos. Arbolian Meterososians. SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,Like were not already under enough pressure
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Geez, Morty. The guys just doing his job. Take it easy."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy Weve got six hours to come up with a song"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Genius happens in the moment, Morty."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Well, can we at least go get our family You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Thats planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning.  Balls."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Morty, Morty, stop Listen Theres only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, were not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,What
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Yeah,  you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities,  Morty. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we cant get schwifty."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,Stop saying it like its a thing You made it up
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Hey, Morty Could you lick my"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Rick, cut it out Thats not funny, Rick"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Nathan,Ive seen enough. These guys are one-hit wonders.
2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"And whats your plan, General"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Nathan,"We still have the nuclear option. On my word, we can launch a nuclear missile at every one of those heads in the sky."
2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"Our planets held captive on a live game show and your solution is to shoot the audience You can put your faith in nukes if we get through this, General. Until then, Ill put mine in Rick and Morty. Get Schwifty was a jam."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Hello Yes sir, yeah. Thank you sir, thank you. He says hes proud of what were doing and hopes we have a great Ascension Festival Happy Ascension"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,We should pack up and leave town now.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"I think its inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream. If youd stop being such an evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,Whoa Look at you Youre wearing the hat and everything
2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Heres yours  Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Yeah, sure. Wait, what"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,I love you guys. You gave me life. And its the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,Dinner sounds nice.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Father, can we please go to the Ascension"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,Sure Lets go to the Ascension. Wh-wh-what is it
2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"We hereby send these un-wantables skyward that they might be inhaled by the many heads, later to be sneezed back to us as better babies  Headward, free now to rise.  Headward, free now to rise.  Headward, free now to rise."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Oh yes, yes Rise to the giant head You are free to be free"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"A squeegee comes up from the garage, right And hes got a lobster in one hand and movie tickets in the other. Hes like, Im ready"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,Who would take a lobster to see Iron Man 3
2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Aw, damn. Were out of original flavor Fig Newtons. I should get going anyway."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Wait, wait, wait Come on, h-hold on a second"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,What
2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,Damn. You didnt tell me you fuck around with portals and shit.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,Thats it
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Whoa, whoa Morty Give me that"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,You lied You lied about the charge You were just being lazy Get back Sit down
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Morty, just put it down. You dont know what youre doing."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,Im going to go find Mom and Dad.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,Nooooo
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Ahhhh, shit"
2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"Ah, shit."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Ahhh, shit."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,And then Ethan played guitar and we learned the Seven Contemplations of the Head by singing them. It was really fun. Praise be the head
2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,Yeah.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Hi folks, Head Priest Vagina. Thanks for farming all those potatoes. Its 6 p.m., so if youre a parent, youre now entitled to adoration from your children."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,Im going to start dinner
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,I dont know what to say. Summer is doing really well here.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"Shes aced every test in potato class, and look how important potatoes have become."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,Shes not getting pregnant or doing drugs or missing curfew
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,Thats not our business as long as Summer is thriving
2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,Taco time  I hope it pleases you as the head desires.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Thats wonderful, Summer"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"Were so proud of you. But honestly, you dont have to make dinner every night."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,"Of course I do, silly  Oh my God, daddy, Im sorry I called you silly Im so sorry  Heavenly head and cranial creator Forgive my transgressions against family and community May my chores complete me as I complete them"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,Morty.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,Birdperson
2,5,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,"You appear to be dying. I will make efforts to prevent this, but can promise nothing."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Wh-What do you think, Ice Probably a little over-developed."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Shit. Over-developed, under-developed. Bad songs are bad songs."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Well, do you think maybe, could you give me some help with it, or "
2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Ah, hell no, man. You do your thing, but I cant afford to get my pride wrapped up in your shame. You know what Im sayin"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Ice, I dont want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but  if Morty doesnt come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, its, uh, kind of your problem too."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Pfff. I aint worried about no Earth blowin up, man."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,What Why not
2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Yo, this is why."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,What the fuck You can turn into ice
2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"My story begins at the dawn of time in the far away realm of Alphabetrium. There, every being is a letter of the alphabet. But I was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything. Earth is just one of the many stops on my lifelong journey with no destination. So you better believe I dont care if it blows up Cause Ill just be ice, floatin through space, like a comet"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Take it from me, Ice.  You cant just  float around space not caring about stuff forever."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Ice-T,"Pshhhh. Man, watch me. Good luck, Rick."
2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"Ok, things are getting out of hand. I better make sure Rick has everything he needs to get schwifty."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Nathan,"Oh, for Gods sake, thats enough."
2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"What the hell are you doing, Nathan Im the goddamn President of the United fuckin States"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Nathan,"Im setting the nuclear option to launch one minute into Earths performance. And you, Mr. President, I hope you like being hit in the face with a gun"
2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"Wait, wait, wait, why-why --"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,I believe I can access the history of Ricks gun and help you get back to him.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,"But can you help me get to my family You know, at my house"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,"Is your intention to abandon Rick using his own portal gun In bird culture, this is considered a dick move."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,"All of Ricks moves are dick moves Wh-what am I eating What is this, bird seed"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,It is random debris. I found it in my carpet. I dont know what humans eat.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,"Dont be gross, Tammy."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Tammy gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesnt care about anyone but himself. He doesnt think about the consequences of anything he does."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,"And as a result, he has the power to save or destroy entire worlds. And he is the reason you and I know each other. And the reason Im alive at all."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,Whats that Whos that baby
2,5,Get Schwifty,Birdperson,"Morty, suppose you could retrieve your family from Earth but had to abandon Rick. I could give your loved ones shelter on Birdworld, even jobs, possibly as worm ranchers. How often do you think you might look up at the stars and wonder what might have been had you just put your faith in Rick"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Cromulon,"That was Chunky Tunk with Full Ming Mong, Empty Gorp Dorp. Up next, planet Earth"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,Oh God Were up
2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Jerry and Beth, your family is a golden example of what Headism has to offer the world."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,The world
2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,Headism is a hit. Were taking it worldwide and would like Jerry to be our churchs Head of Advertising.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,You would
2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,"Beth, wed like to promote you from horse surgeon, straight past human surgeon, to Head of Medicine."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,Thats my dream Thats my dream.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"Thank you. This is all so overwhelming, but, uh we cant."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,Absolutely not.
2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,Im sorry
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Weve been waiting 16 years for our daughter to respect us, but the key is, it has to be our daughter, not this person shes become."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,Well take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs outside of a potato-based religion.  And you know what Im sick of pretending that were together because of the kids in the first place I married you because youre the love of my life
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"And Im lucky to have you and I never tell you that You know, we will come out of this stronger as a family"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Beth,"Please dont do this, please dont do this Summer"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,"Summer, listen carefully. I stole a paper clip and I have it in my cheek but I dont know what to do with it and it hurts."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Summer,Youre going to be ok  You will come back as babies
2,5,Get Schwifty,Jerry,I AM a baby Im a baby NOW

2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,Oh my God C-c-can you fly a Blackhawk
2,5,Get Schwifty,President,Can the Popes dick fit through a donut
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Uhhh, Im not sure"

2,5,Get Schwifty,Mr. Goldenfold,Hey Look at the heads Looks like the heads are gettin angry
2,5,Get Schwifty,President,"Im really bad at this, Morty There are way too many buttons on this thing"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Morty,"Mr. President, if Ive learned one thing today, its that sometimes, you have to not give a fuck"
2,5,Get Schwifty,Rick,"Nup-oo-nup-oo-nup-oo-nups ooh, tough crowd."
2,5,Get Schwifty,Principal Vagina,Im sure that has that has nothing to do with this.

2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,Why would you keep mutant bacteria in a pint of Cherry Garcia
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,"I know this isnt the time, but, you know, technically the second freezer drawer is mine."

2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Morty,"Huh Uh, no no no, Im-Im just looking at that lady getting coffee. Whats up with her face Is she a human or is she like Worf. You know Worf, from Star Trek, where he has the shit all over his face but hes just a human in a costume, you know"
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,Morty lets-lets see what else is on.
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Morty,Okay.
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Morty,Whoa Look Its that lady with all that shit on her face like Worf from Star Trek That was getting coffee How did she get there
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,"Oh, man Morty. How DID she get there"
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,Is that something we should be concerned about
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,Just stay away from the coffee machine.
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Announcer,"In a world, where there are eight Jan-Michael Vincents."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Announcer,And sixteen quadrants. Theres only enough time for a Jan-Michael Vincent to make it to a quadrant. He cant be in two quadrants at once.
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Morty,"Rick, who-who is Jan-Michael Vincent"
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,"Oh man, Im trying to remember Morty."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Announcer,Jan-Michael Vincents are used up.
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Morty,Is it important that we know who Jan-Michael Vincent is in order to get this
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,Nope.
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Announcer,"This January, Its time to Mike down your Vincents. Jan Quadrant Vincent 16."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,Thats Jan-Michaels.
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Morty,"Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature Because I think I have Jan Quadrant Vincent fever over here."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Rick,"All right, Morty youve done it"
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"So, well be detaching your sexual organ at the base by making incisions here,here, and here."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,Got it.
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,Leaving a partial length of severed urethra to be threaded through-
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Oh, you know what, I gotta laugh at myself here Im having a little laugh at myself because I just realized I havent run this whole decision past my wife."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"Oh, do you think shell be okay with this"
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Oh, absolutely. Beth is automatically on board, always, with every decision I make."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,Smith family
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,Yes
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,I wanted to let you all know that Jerry is doing just fine.
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"But, ah, Mrs. Smith, could you come with me"
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Hi, honey, so, heres the thing-these guys-they want to completely remove my penis and use it as an aliens heart, and we just need you to sign off on it."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,WHAT
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Uh-oh, maybe we have a problem here after all guys. Yikes."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"His penis will be replaced with a sophisticated prosthetic, now theres a wide range of options to chose from, theyre all in this catalog."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"I dont care about prosthetics, this is insane What do you people think youre doing"
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"I understand your feelings, Mrs. Smith."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"Oh, I dont think you do. I bring my husband in for emergency medical treatment, hes gone an hour, and now you want his PENIS, and you hand me some... catalog. Its--Its--Its--Its, I mean."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Sheesh, well, there you go. Sorry. I know its hard to understand but on Earth, love comes first."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,"There are those that believe, Mr. Smith, that Shrimply Pibbles represents love between all life. That his fate will determine the fate of hundreds of billions of sentient life forms."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"Woah Woah. So, billions of life forms"
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Alien Doctor,Hundreds of billions.
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"I mean, Jerry, y-you didnt explain the full gravity of the situation."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Uh, well, Beth, I dont think your decision should be based on politics. Who could argue with a wifes decision to keep her LOVER INTACT."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"Well I dont think thats fair at all, Jerry. At all. In fact, I think this whole paradigm has sexist overtones."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"Beth, can we talk about this privately"
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"You know, I think, the bottom line is, Jerry, if you want to keep your penis, you should say, out loud, I prefer to keep my penis."
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Jerry,"But, Beth, what kind of man would say something like that if the universe needed his penis"
2,8,Interdimensional Cable 2  Tempting Fate,Beth,"Well, Jerry, what kind of wife would I be if I did anything to stand in your way"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Anyway, thats how I escaped from space prison Oh, scary place."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Wow, Rick Thats -- Thats one -- one heck of a story. I sure do wish I could have been there to see it happen."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Oh, come on. Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools to take out highly trained alien guards when we can sit here and be a family at Shoneys"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,"Dad, its great to have you back, no matter where we are, but wouldnt you like to go home"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Emotionally speaking, honey, Shoneys is my home."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,"Yeah, but you just got out of prison. I mean, how much of a step up from that is --"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Jerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off, and fold yourself 12 times."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,You got it.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Six folds, huh W-W-What, have you guys got me in a Series 9000 You cheap insect fucks didnt think I was worth your best equipment"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Man, I told the money bugs. I said, You know who this guy is, right You want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal in the galaxy, you better give me a decent brainalyzer."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I dont see the need to leave this part of my brain."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Oh, I think you do. Eventually, youre either gonna relax your cerebellum."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Shoneys.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Relaxed enough
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"I admire you, Rick--"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,When I--
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Rick, heres--"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,"I tell ya, the Galactic Federation taking over Earth -- best thing thats ever happened to this family. I just got my sixth promotion this week, and I still dont know what I do."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Who cares how high they promote you Everyone just gets paid in pills.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,"Well, when youre not sure what you do for a living, you can make your own rules."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,"Summer, show your father some respect. Hes pulling down a six-chewable figure income."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"I kind of had big pills for lunch, and I  wasnt gonna eat any more pills.  Thank you, Conroy."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,"You spoil us, Conroy."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Grandpa Rick wouldnt put up with this
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,Stop saying his name He abandoned us.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,Willem Dafoe Th-Thats the guy I couldnt think of this morning.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,"Dont make my mistake, Summer. Dont deify the people that leave you. Youll end up a horse surgeon in a world controlled by aliens whose medicine keeps horses  healthy forever.  Horses live longer than tortoises now. Is that what you want for yourself"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Maybe I just want you to care if I run away yelling
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,Ooh
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Oh, any particular ones You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick," Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean youre aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Its arousal. Yes, Id like very much to visit the memory of you inventing your portal gun."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Yeah, well, tough titties."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Well, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Someone special you remember Is that your memory of her out there -- between where you were on 9/11 and your favorite sports blooper
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"If we stay here, youll die, along with all your memories. If you take me where I want to go shell be there, too, wont she"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Oh, that sounds cool. I can get what I want and you can say goodbye."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Fine, but Im driving."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Huh What are you -- What are you doing
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Grandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right With, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank And we can go break him out of prison Look at these dead flies Maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Summer, youre freaking me out. I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick, but getting him back wouldnt make things better. And, you know, were not doing so bad."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Were miserable, Morty Theres a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the Eiffel Tower"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Hey, I like being 35. I-I can rent a car now."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Because you suck Youve been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, youre freaking stoked to bail on him."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"He bails on everybody He bailed on Mom when she was a kid He -- He bailed on tiny planet And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesnt care Because nobodys special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that wont let you down is buried in your backyard"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Youre right
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"What No, Im not right. I-I was using ghoulish overkill Ghoulish overkill, Summer"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Oh, God Oh, God Whoa, whoa"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Where are we going
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,To the day it all began and ended. The moment that changed everything.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Yeah, Id like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as youre allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film Mulan, where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and its delicious And then they got rid of it, and now its gone. This is the only place were gonna be able to try it, is in my memory."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Rick, youre doing this bit while your brain is melting."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Okay. All right, all right."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Is that--
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Me. I used to wear blue pants.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Whend you make the leap to interdimensional travel
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,I didnt. I did.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,What
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Summer, nobody has to know about that. We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it, like we did with Dads mannequin leg."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Fine, stay here. Ill rescue Grandpa myself."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,And how are you gonna do that
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,I dont know yet. Ill make it up as I go. Thats what Grandpa Rick does. Thats what heroes do.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Y-You want to see what a hero Rick is I-Ill bring you somewhere, Summer. Um-"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,What is this place And whats with Hunger Games Summer
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Thats my sister. This used to be my home.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,Sounds lonely.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,"Eh, pass."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,"A different kind of Rick, I guess."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,"Sort of. I just took a long look at myself, and I dont think this science thing is gonna pay off."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,"That, Dianne, is the last great idea that will ever be had in this garage."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Good roasted Cronenberg, I assume. Mom, youre looking feral. I cant believe Rick did this."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"These are the parts of Ricks adventures you dont get to see -- the parts he leaves behind. All right, its been great, guys. I really only wanted to stop by here for a quick I told ya so. So, uh--"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,What are you doing with that
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,No Why Why would you do that W-W-What is the matter with you people
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Hold your fire Hold your fire Im Morty C-137.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Hes in prison.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Summer.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,He got captured by the Federation and we were going to rescue him.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Boo-yah
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Boo-nah
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,"Come on, girls The ice creams gonna melt."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,Nooooooo
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Wow. This sauce is fucking amazing. You said it was promoting a movie
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Young Rick,"Carry the three, add a two. I got it. I fucking got it."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Whoa. I-Is that it, the portal gun"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Yeah. Thats the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Awesome-possum.  Mission Control, you getting this"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,"Yeah Thanks, Rick. Ill try to remember to shut off the brainalyzer. Actually, I think it shuts off automatically once your brain is liquid. Dont know, dont care. Pull me out.  Hey, pull me out Can you hear me"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Nope, they cannot."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Why not
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Because the code you just uploaded wasnt actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,What are you talking about This is a memory. Y-You cant alter details of a memory.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Its a trap Abort Im still in his Shoneys Repeat -- we never left his Shoneys
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Okay, have fun in whats left of my brain. Im gonna transfer to yours. Oh, theres not enough room for all my genius, so Im leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Cornvelious Daniel,Its a trap Abort We never left his --   No
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,A city of Grandpas
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Its the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"But if every Rick hates the government, why would they hate Grandpa"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Because Ricks hate themselves the most. And our Rick is the most himself.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"Operating an unregistered portal gun, radicalizing a Summer, conspiring with a traitorous Rick. How do you plead"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,How is this a fair trial O-Our lawyer is a Morty.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"Its not fair, you have no rights, and hes not a lawyer. We just keep him here because hes fun. Look at him go."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"Well be lenient if you renounce your Rick. What say you, Summer"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"I say fuck you My grandpa was my hero. You killed him because you were jealous of him. Thats pretty obvious from the haircuts. So do what you want to me, but let my brother go. He already renounced Rick."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,Morty
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"What N-No, I dont want to see your Pog collection. I dont renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. Thats something you cant have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, hes not a villain, Summer, but he shouldnt be your hero. Hes more like a demon or a super fucked up god."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"Lets not suck the ghost of his dick too hard. He was a terrorist, and now hes dead."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Oh, yeah If you think my Ricks dead, hes alive. And if you think youre safe, hes coming for you"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"All right, calm down We have his Summer as a hostage. Obviously, I get her. You guys play Rick, Laser, Scissors for the Morty."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Grandpa Rick
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Duh
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Youre alive
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Rick
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Morty, take this. Youre gonna need it later."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"Thats enough, Rick."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,What -- Whats this supposed to accomplish We have infinite grandkids. Youre trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesars Palace here.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Thats a bluff. Hes bluffing, sir. He loves me."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"Youre a rogue Rick -- irrational, passionate. You love your grandkids. You came to rescue them."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"I came to kill you, bro. Thats not even my original Summer."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Oh, my God. Hes not bluffing. Hes not bluffing"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,R-Rick
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,Why not shoot through her
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which Im encouraging you to do."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,What the fuck
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,Because you love her
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Because its incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, Im super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,I hate you
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Not an issue, sweetie."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Thats enough Drop the gun, Rick"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Morty, I know youre too stupid to get this, but youre really fuckin this up right now."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Im not letting you let my sister die Drop the gun
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"I wasnt gonna let her die, you fuckin moron"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,Ha
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Aww.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,The point is he thought I was going to.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"I totally did, by the way. Youre a fucking moron, Morty."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Morty, you fucking idiot"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Youre a serious fuckin idiot, Morty You basically killed us all Youre the worst Youre as dumb as a bag of sand."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Whos stupid now, bitch"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Morty, we just got him back"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Riq IV,"That was amazing, Morty. Oh, my God. Wow. Okay, lets wrap this-"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Good job, Morty. Lets go, kids."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,What What happened
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Oldest Rick trick in the book.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Fake gun, shoot me in standoff. Brilliant."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Ha, yeah. G-Good thing I saw that note."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Cant we just portal home
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Not until I finish what I started. And that is how you get level-nine access without a password.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Employee of the month, ladies and gentlemen."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"So, what are you doing with level-nine access anyways"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Destroying the  galactic government.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,Are you going to set all their nukes to target each other
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Ooh, or -- or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Good pitches, kids. Im almost proud. But watch closely as Grandpa topples an empire by changing a one to a zero."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Mr. Goldenfold,No longer will the insects have domain over surface world
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,"Jerry, what the hell is happening"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,The galactic government collapsed.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,Are you okay
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,"Look, I-Im not proud to share this, but the truth is, I just kept crawling, and it kept working.  Oh, Im glad youre okay. Are we ever going to stop paying for indulging your father Our children, our planet, our jobs Is there anything left to lose"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,"Just each other, and Ill never let you go. And Im so sorry I ever did this to us."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Guess who dismantled the government
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,Please dont leave me again.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"I never will, baby."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,I was right. He turned himself in on purpose. It was all part of his plan
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Jerry, is there any light beer left Its insane what you miss in prison."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,"Um..okay. No. No, no, no. Foot down time."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"No, youre right. Wheres the vodka"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Jerry,"Beth, its him or me"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Seems like you guys need some privacy. Ill, uh -- Ill be in the garage."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"What the fuck Not cool, Jerry A mans garage is his castle."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,Jerrys going to spend some time divorced.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Oh, I-Im sorry to hear that, sweetie. I hope I had nothing to do with that."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,"Oh, God, Dad, that is not your burden to bear. I feel terrible that I misjudged you. This is gonna be good for Jerry."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,For everybody.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Beth,For everybody.

3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Summer,"Oh, my God. Nancy says theyre drawing and quartering aliens in the school courtyard, and it technically counts as patriotism."

3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Oh, fuck."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,Ive replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldnt have accepted me if I came home -
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"Oh, man."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"- without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. Oh I just took over the family, Morty, and if you tell your mom -"

3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"- and theyll take my side because Im a hero, Morty. And now youre gonna have to go -"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Oh.
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"- and do whatever I say, Morty, forever And Ill -- Ill go out and Ill find some more of that Mulan Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty. -"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,What are you talking about
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"- Because thats -- thats what this is all about, Morty."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,Szechuan
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Thats my one-armed man Im not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty That was fake. I-I-Im driven by finding that McNugget sauce."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,McNuggets
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"I want that Mulan McNugget sauce, Morty Thats my series arc, Morty."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,What the hell

3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,"What are you talking about, Rick"
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Thats whats gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,What are you talking about
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"Season -- Nine more seasons, Morty. Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce."
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Morty,What is that
3,1,The Rickshank Rickdemption,Rick,"For 97 more years, Morty"

3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,Rick
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Hey, Mooorty"

3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,Rick W-where are you
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"On my work bench, Morty."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Are you invisible and youre gonna, like, fart on me"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Flip the pickle over.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"What, Im gonna touch it, and youre gonna tell me its an alien dick or something."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. Youre not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,And
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"And What more do you want tacked on to this I turned myself into a pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,Was it
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Who cares, Morty Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, heres something thats never happened before"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"I dont do magic, Morty, I do science. One takes brains, the other takes dark eye liner."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Well, can you move Can you fly"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,I wouldnt be much of a pickle if I could.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"All right, well, do pickles live forever or --"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Morty, stop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed. Im a pickle."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,I-Im just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"The reason anyone would do this is, if they could, which they cant, would be because they could, which they cant."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Morty, we have to get going, or were gonna be late. Wheres your grandpa"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Right here, sweetie. Im a pickle"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"What Why would you -- Look, were running late. We have to go."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Where are you guys going
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"We have an appointment downtown that was set a week ago and agreed upon by everyone, including you."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, my God. Beth, oh, it totally slipped my mind. Geez, oh, man. Im a pickle. I mean, I dont know if I can, ooh, geez."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Morty
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Its okay, Beth. I understand Mortys suspicion. Ive misled him before. Morty, turn me so were making eye contact.Morty, I assure you, I would never find a way to get out of family therapy. I hope my lack of fingers doesnt prevent the perception of my air quotes."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Summer,Cant you just turn yourself back into a human
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before Im able to figure out how to return to human form. But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Nobody needs anything Okay, its fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Well, Morty, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Enough. Kids, its time to go. We dont want to be late."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"W-w-what are you doing there, Beth What are you doing there, sweetie"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Well, I mean, you dont want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation. Hows that gonna help"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Cant argue with that.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Great. Well see you later.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Hey, hey, be careful with that. Its for something else. Its really important, so dont break it. Okay, I may have fucked up here. Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. T-t-tah, tah.  Oh, great. Stupid cat."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but Im not a snake Ive seen the YouTube videos, I know cats are scared of cucumbers and pickles because they think theyre snakes. Im not a snake Im a pickle, Im a pickle"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Whoa Oh Whoa, whoa, whoa"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, crap, that sun is bright."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Okay, come on. This cant really be the way I go out. This is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,So... hot. This is how Im gonna die.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, God, moisture."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, God, the moisture Dial it back, God Dial it back a little bit here"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Oh Oh
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, God Perpendicular, perpendicular"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, shiiit Oh Oh Oh"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Come on. Thats it.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Come get this delicious brine.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Aah Come on Come on, motherfucker Come on"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Yes
3,3,Pickle Rick,Summer,How is this even family therapy if Dads not invited and Grandpa wont come
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Yeah, and whats courageous about eating a hot dog"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Its nobodys choice to be here, you knobs. The family was told to get counseling by your principal, even though its not the family that was huffing pottery glaze in the art room and desk wetting in history class."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Mr. Goldenfold,"Oh, the Smith family, minus a dad. Youre patients of Dr. Wong, too"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Temporarily. By order of the school.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Mr. Goldenfold,Me too. How long have you all been eating poop
3,3,Pickle Rick,Summer,We... have never... eaten poop.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Mr. Goldenfold,"Uh, me, neither. Say, where did my family get off to"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Smith family, Im Dr. Wong. Come on in."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,I was told there was a grandpa that might be joining us
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"He got wrapped up in an experiment. Hes a scientist. Like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very --"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,He turned himself into a pickle.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Morty, Moms talking. Im sorry, I suppose thats a good segue into our little discipline cases here."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"What No, what kind of question is that"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,The kind that wasnt designed to attack or hurt you in any way.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. Hes unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which..."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Okay, lets open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this. Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Wow. Ugh.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"I didnt say my father is perfect, I said his work is important."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Summer,And shes saying whats important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Oh, he did not"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Lets do an experiment here. I get the impression this family values science. So raise your hand if you feel certain you know what was in the syringe.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Do you really not see whats happening here
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Tell me.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Well, Dr. Wong -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your familys dysfunction. I think its possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I dont think its one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think its possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Fuck you.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Fuck both of you, too."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath. Thats because, to me, you arent special."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"God damn it, I love myself."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Pickle Riiick
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Get that parkour. Get that parkour
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Hey, its cool. Just need to find the nearest exit."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Whoa, whoa, whoa No need to freak out."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Whoa Who in the fucks toilet is this
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,What is it
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Where is it
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"We have 34 armed guards, and we cant kill a pickle"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Put him on, and locate the phone hes using."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Hi, um, can you, uh  please let me out."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Your mere presence in this building violates international law.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,You should know those men killed themselves.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,And how is that
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,They didnt  let me out.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Shut your mouth and do your jobs, you fucking children"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Uh, is this not a good time or..."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Some of my men are calling you Solenya
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Thatd be a lucky break for you.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Ah.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,...because this pickle doesnt care about your children. And Im not gonna take their dreams. Im gonna take their parents.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Hes just a pickle
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Hes not the only one.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Then Katarina is a prisoner. Perhaps I could arrange her escape, as well. She lives, Jaguar."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"What do you think is in the syringe, Beth"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Youre the one that costs 200 an hour. You tell me.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Summer,I never said I was angry at you.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Thats the point of pottery-enamel huffing, Summer. You do it so you dont have to say Im angry at mommy out loud."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Oh, my God"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Its not my job to take sides or pass judgment. Do you think when your father asks for that syringe, you could ask him --"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"He wont have to ask for it, okay He wont need it. Hell just make more. He doesnt need anything from anyone."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,You admire him for that.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Its better than making your problems other peoples problems.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, come on"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,You should know that isnt original.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Theres nothing I wont do to see her again.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Yeah, theres lots I wouldnt do to see my daughter, but killing you gets me to her quicker than your derivative bullshit."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"That will be your downfall, Jaguar, not being open to new experiences."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Jaguar couldnt make it.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Do it. Okay, you win, Pickle Man. Im unsealing the building."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"No, thanks. Im coming for you now."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Pickle Man, theres 100 million worth of bonds in a safe on level two. Ill give you the combination."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Shut up and call me a helicopter, you prick Do we have a deal"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Take that money, give it to Jaguars daughter when you set her free. Or Ill be visiting you."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Jaguars daughter is dead.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Huh, so youre a liar."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Jaguar was an animal. Youre an intelligent pickle. We can do business.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,I dont think so. See you soon.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Is the helicopter here
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,Tell them we were robbed.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Agency Director,"Farewell, Solenya."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Well, my daughter is about five away, and Ive got about eight to live."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, well, uh, she knows. I mean, we dont really buy into that kind of crap, to the extent that love is an expression of familiarity over time, my access to infinite timelines precludes the necessity of attachment. In fact, I even abandoned one of my infinite daughters in an alternate version of earth that was taken over by mutants."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Huh Uh, no. No, nope, sorry about that. Nope, just me. Yeesh"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,I am afraid that my kids will get expelled.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Good. Summer, you go."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Summer,I am mad that I cant huff enamel without people assuming its because my family sucks. I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Good job. Morty, do you have an I statement"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,I am sad that I peed. Im sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Look at this family go. You guys are pros. What do you guys think about doing this once a week
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Ugh.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,You must be Rick.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Mm-hmm.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Ive heard a lot about you today. Your family is crazy about you. Your daughter holds you in very high regard. Youre a lucky fella.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Yeah, thank you. Uh, sweetie, you dont still happen to have that syringe in your purse"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Dad I would like you to tell me whats in the syringe.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Its a serum that I need to, uh, to stay alive. I have had a rough day. And, uh, Ive sustained a lot of damage. Im pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,By changing you from a pickle to a human.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Yes.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Rick, why did you lie to your daughter"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,So I wouldnt have to come here.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,Why didnt you want to come here
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Because I dont respect therapy, because Im a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I dont like something about the world, I change it. And I dont think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.  I think its helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. Im not a cow. Im a pickle. When I feel like it. So...you asked."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Dr. Wong,"Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.  You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think its because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that its your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle.  You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way Im bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is its not an adventure. Theres no way to do it so wrong you might die. Its just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some pee well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"I, um Im sorry I lied to get out of the thing. I, I shouldnt lie to you."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Oh, its fine. I mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldnt. But I hope you know thats not what that session was supposed to be."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Oh, no, I mean, I know it was Morty peeing his pants and Summer snorting glue or whatever..."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"She huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Well, there was so much more at stake. I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Summer,Are we gonna go back
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Sweetie, could I get Get that syringe now"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Oh, my God, yes Dad, its in my purse. Oh, Im sorry. You must be in agony."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,Eh.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Pickle Rick,"Jesus. Jesus Christ. Therapists, man."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,Weird breed.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Rick,"Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"Really Like, go somewhere Yeah, lets drop the kids off and go tie one on."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Rick,Absolutely.
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"I, I liked her."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Beth,"So what are you thinking, like, Smokeys Tavern Maybe Shoneys"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Rick,"Yeah, either one. Either one."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Rick,"Youll never get away with this, Concerto."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Rick,"This is it, Morty. Were goners. Were not getting out of this one. After everything weve been through, this is how were gonna die. Make peace with your god."
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I dont want to die"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Rick,Jaguar
3,3,Pickle Rick,Morty,"Who Who was that, Rick"
3,3,Pickle Rick,Rick,"That, Morty, is why you dont go to therapy."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Dont let any of those things get away, Morty. If their DNA gets into Earths food chain, our entire species could be sterilized."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Then why arent we killing them
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Great. Next time I need a species sterilized, whos gonna do it for me You"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Oh, Rick I-Is that the Vindibeacon Were being called to assemble by the Vindicators"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure, Morty. Let it go to voicemail"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Rick, the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake Theyre first line of defense against evil Theyre the guardians of the unguarded"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Theyre the writers of their own press releases, Morty Theyre a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking and twenty minutes jumping around while shit blows up. Theyre a phase. We did one, it was the big event of that summer. Let it die."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"I, Morty Smith, invoke my right to choose one in every ten Rick and Morty adventures.  Read em and weep."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,God... fuckin dammit  Fine But dont say I didnt warn you.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Yes  Vindicator command ship, beacon received Were doing Vindicators Twoooooooooo"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Whoops Uh, Morty, you might want to freeze some sperm."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Vindicators, Worldender is back..."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"..and this time, hes out to end more than worlds. We have reason to believe his stronghold is located on..."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,My balls.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Rick
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"...the Terraneus system. Once in range, Million Ants will scan for pheromone activity, which should lead us to the location of the base."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Oh, thats Million Ants. I cant see the ants over here. It just assumed that was, uh, Turd Man. Wiggly Turd Man."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Rick, stop"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Rick, you have something to add to the briefing"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.  Um, this guy. The, uh... The, uh..."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Right, Crocubot. So, youre half-cold, unfeeling reptile, half-also cold, equally-unfeeling machine."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"So, youre origin is what Y-You fell into a vat of redundancy"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Noob-Noob, were having a briefing  If I can continue, Rick. I anticipate sophisticated security measures. I trust you can be of service there."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Well, let me check my list of powers and weaknesses. Ability to do anything... But only whenever I want... Yeah, that sounds like a job for me."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,I wish he had the ability to check is attitude.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Alan Rails, ladies and gentleman. After his parents tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghiost trains. Its not all bad, though. They were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Thanks, Noob-Noob This guy gets it."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Vance Maximus, Renegade Star Soldier"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,Sorry Im late. It was happy hour.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Happy hour.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Uh, I was also late because of my drinking and metioned it to zero applause."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Rick Sanchez, Tinkerer of Terror. Man, thats hard to say. And... Morty, right"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Whoa, yeah"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"I never forget a kid.  What do you say, Vindicators Lets make this three for three"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Did he say three for three
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Did he say he never forgets a kid
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"You mean two for two, right, Vance"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Actually, we assembled a second time last summer to fight Doomnomitron."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"So, this is... Vindicators 3 And you guys did Vindicators 2... w-without us"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,I sense... insecurity.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,Are you sure theres not just a picnic nearby.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"I guess he found his crowd. Pretty toothless stuff, guys."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"I hope youre happy with the adventure so far, Morty. These guys are even lamer than last time."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"We werent here last time, remember They did a whole Vindicators without us. A bunch of them got killed, too. They lost Lady Katana, Calypso, Diablo Verde..."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Yikes. Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,This article says the reason we werent involved was... personality conflicts.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Dont worry, Morty, they love you. Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like its mind-blowing."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,I... think the personality conflict might have been... you.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Jesus... How awesome is that I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad, they murdered three innocent heroes of color, and they still had to bring me back"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Rick, since its my adventure and all, could you do me a favor"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty. Me sleeping on these linens is the favor. I mean, w-w-w-what--what are we vindicating Comfort"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Rick, this really bums me out. It-Its embarrassing to find out these guys dont like us."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Why Morty,  I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Yeah, but not heroes."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Oh, please. They just call themselves heroes so they can..."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Im calling them that, Rick Theyre my heroes Mine"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Huh... no accounting for taste. Im gonna go get a drink.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Oh, God."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Good morning. Looks like your grandpa had a long night. Crocubot, why dont you escort Mr. Sanchez to a more comfortable spot so that someone can...  clean up his diarrhea."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Actually, Noob-Noob, you have a new mission."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Vindicators, prepare for arrival."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Morty, the Vindicators and I had a chat this morning and Im afraid we need to make a little change."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,I-I totally get it. I-Im so sorry.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,You should be.  Running around in a yellow t-shirt like youre not one of us Disgraceful.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,I-I-I... Im not a superhero.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Cop a squat, chief.  Everyone in the universe is a hero. All you have to do is know the difference between good and bad, and root for good."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Rick says good and bad are artificial constructs.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Yeah, well, I get the feeling... he kind of needs that to be the case.  Not coming, Noob-Noob"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Security drones, inbound."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Star Mother, grant me your wrath"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,All aboard
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Aah  Gun turret.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Are you all right
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Yes. I only lost 400 ants. My queen is laying more.  I am back to one million ants.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Someone wake up Sanchez.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Ugh Oh, Christ..."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Rick, youre up."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Barely.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Rick, were taking fire from an automated turret. Can you bring it offline"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Uh-huh.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Uh, my God, thats better."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,RICK
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Hey, I cant help if I cant see."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,I couldve just used a ghost train.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Really You dont say. You would have used a ghost train  Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"Man, fuck you."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Is there coffee Hey, Morty, can you be a pal Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship. Y-You know, the French press thing"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Get it yourself.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Little extra  snippy this morning, arent you"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Just focus on the mission, all right"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Oh, oh, oh, Im sorry. Oh, youre right. Ooh, real serious. Gotta take it real serious, huh"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,Son of a steam engine Theyre all dead
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Well, he is the Worldender. The guy ends worlds. Kind of his thing."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Ooh, real scared. Real fucking on alert, high alwrt over here."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,What the FUCK
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Its Worldender What happened to him
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,I sense his life force is fading.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Million Ants, ladies and gentleman The ant colony with the power of two human eyes"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"All right. Short mission, good mission. Remember when Alan wanted to use a ghost train See you guys in Vindicators 4. Morty"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Rick, whoever did this is an even bigger threat than Worldender We cant leave now"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Hes right. This is far from over.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Well, have fun with that. But Morty and I have to meet a comet girl, a monorail man, two assholes and a full alligator in, like, an hour."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Shit.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,I sense the presence of a greater evil.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Check, check, One, two. Okay, is it recording Good. Hello, Vindicators. Welcome to your reckoning, babyyyyyyyy"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Welp, its official. I had too much to drink last night."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"If you guys are watching this, youre, you know, the Vindicators. So now that we know..."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Rick Whats going on, buddy"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Obviously You came here and defeated our arch-nemesis while so drunk, you dont remember doing it Thats something obvious to you"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Look, Im a lit-- little more complex than you guys and, no offense, but Ive always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"...So I thought, why not just do your job for you so we can have a little fun game."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Rick, is-is this a Saw thing Are you seriously Saw-ing the Vindicators"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Morty Im a drunk, not a hack."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"If you break the rules, lose the game or try to leave, you will die. Like in  Sawwww."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Well, I-I-I think weve seen enough. Ill just figure out how to unplug this."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Okay, here we go, room number one. The Vindicators are known throughout the galaxy, but do they know yourselves Do you know yourselves Match your... your shit, your... your gimmicks with your faces and y-you get it, its a matching thing. And do it in three minutes, or youll  all die."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,Screw this. Im not playing his game. Im gonna find us a way out of here.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance. He said youd die if you tried to leave. That means theres booby traps."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,Why are you acting like thats not you
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,What part of blackout dont you understand I thought you drank
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Like cool drinking Like sexy drinking, not this psycho trailer-park shit"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Vance, stay calm..."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Oh, so youre the leader now because we gave you a jacket Youre the learning-disabled kid we do photo-ops with"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Okay, ouch, but..."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Vance,"Okay, this... this is triggering me. I need space. I-I need SPACE FROM THIS"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,Give me one good reason why I shouldnt crush your windpipe
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"And because, like I said, I dont remember last night."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,I told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Alan, Im not proud of whats happening here, but if you keep coming at me, theres gonna be another passenger on that ghost train."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Guys  Ive figured it out.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,Congrats You did it-- it
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,It was a bit. All of the descriptors apply to all of you. Drunk Ricks point is that none of you are very special or different.  Thats always his point.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Lets just get through this as quickly as possible. Then, well deal with the two of you."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,The two of us  I hope youre proud of yourself
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Uh, I kind of am. I saved the goddamn universe."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Thats not the issue, Rick"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Ahh, it wouldve been if I hadnt."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"The Vindicators say their job is is to fight evil wherever it hides, but they dont... pick the location youll... youll never even hear them mention, because to fight darkness is to fight yourself."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Crocubot, dont"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Huh, Im seeing more croc than bot here."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Goddammit
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Uh, what happened on Dorian 5"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Nothing
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,Nothing We exterminated a planet
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"W-Wait, huh"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Doomnomitron was hiding here Hes a shapeshifter Destroying Dorian 5 was the only way to kill him
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Oh, o-okay. This again"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"You know,  I could have made a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like  that."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Im not the one that didnt want you back. Alan was
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,If you lay those deaths at my doorstep one more time...
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Do not threaten her
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Congrats, you did it"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,What the hell is Is-ra-el
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,I-Its just something Rick starts talking about whenever hes blackout drunk.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"W-What In w--In w-w-what--In what way Like, w-w-whats my point"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"In a way that has no point You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations, and then you pass out"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"So, to be clear, I sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic, which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,I have no stake in this.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"I dont either. I-Im just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel, he wants whats best for it and..."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,"Hey, man, Im not touching this. You do you."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Aloha... means hello and goodbye in Hawaii. But, uh, aloha means... has nothing to do with this room.  Im so fucking drunk. Ugh, okay, heres the deal. I-I want to rest my eyes for a little bit. Im--Im not going to sleep. I just... just need to rest my eye, so lets make this one simple. Just try to hit some three-pointers."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"lets say... you have to hit... five three-pointers in... five minutes or, I dont know, the whole place--the whole planet will get blown up with a n-neutrino bomb. And try to make it a-a lesson about yourselves like, like how... selfish you a-are, or something. Also, Hawaii."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"You guys hit the baskets. Ill disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb. Theres a 40% chance its a dud, but y-you should still stay back."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Morty, how many of these..."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Too many, Rick Too many"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Man, I am really getting high-roaded today."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,Thats a three-pointer
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,Nice shot.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Thank you.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,You two make quite a team.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,We all do.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"Yeah, I guess."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,Thats a three-pointer
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,But you guys have always had a... an unspoken bond.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"I mean, really unspoken. Like, lets-not-tell-my-husband unspoken."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"We arent married anymore, Alan."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"Sure, but were we married when you two were stranded on Delphi 6 for three days Because I sensed something was weird when you can back. But what do I know about sensitivity Im just a phantom train conductor. Youre the pile of ordinary bugs that fucked my wife"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,Thats a three-pointer
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Where the fuck is the lead wire
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"You always put it in the weirdest place Um, uh, over here, maybe"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb. its a miracle I actually every destroy anything."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Oh, I dont know. You managed to destroy just about everything today the villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood..."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Thank you. I appreciate it, Morty. I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid out of the Vindicators dicks, so the fact that I was right about them must be pretty hard to admit."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick Because when youre an asshole, it doesnt matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"I know. Everyone wants people they like to be right. Thats why popular people are fucking dumb. And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can a eat a double-decker shit sandwich.  Disarmed."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Holy shit. Youre jealous.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,YES Is that what you want to hear
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"Did it feel good Did you like his six million wriggling legs more than my tragedy-stricken, half-ghost, half-tumescent penis"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,Thats a three-pointer
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Guys, stop Youre just proving my asshole grandpa right"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,You wish this was about sex We loved each other We had a child together.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,WHAT
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"I conceived a child with Million Ants and it died inside me because it as HALF A MILLION ANTS AND HALF COLLAPSING STAR And yes, he was better than you"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,Yeah
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,One million times better
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Alan,"ALL ABOOOOOOARD, MOTHERFUCKER"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,STOP
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Oof Didnt see that comin.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Is that sarcasm  I dont want you slipping away then this is over All of these deaths are on your hands
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Oh, come on, maybe a couple of them, but definitely not the train guy."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,All of them.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,O-kayyy...
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Congrats, you did it"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"All right, buy now, Ive been pretty clear that I thunk the Vindicators are  full of shit. But... you do have one thing Ill never have. And that thing is the only part of the Vindicators with any value to me. if you know what it is, place it on the platform.Guess wrong and the pla... planet will explode. And probably the solar system, cause I kind of fucking eyeballed the neutrino bombs on this one."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"So whats the trick Morty, youre the Drunk Rick expert."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"I think... no matter what we put on there, we die. he said its the part of the Vindicators he values. That means nothing. He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Jesus Okay, open to second opinions"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,I could--It could be Morty.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,What
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Hey, I dont know. I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and theres no logic to it. its, like, possible I got so drunk, I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying Okay, you can have him, but only if you know how important he is, otherwise Ill kill you."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,That is a... really specific guess.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Look, I... theres nothing in the room but us. Im just using logic to connect some dots. Its the best guess Ive got."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,But youre betting our lives on it.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Ill cover that bet. I get it.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Well, Morty, I think youre making that smirky face because youre misinterpreting the moment. I am not being coy about some hidden love for you. I want to be really clear that, if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or..."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Oh, shit."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Sorry, Im... not good at goodbyes. It looks like Im never gonna see you again. I cant really roll with the hero types, and I dont... th-they dont want me around. But I want... you to know, even if I didnt show it at the time, II really appreciated you sticking by me."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Goddammit, why am I crying It makes no sense."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Ugh, y-youre probably confused because we barely know each other..."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"...but you really stuck your neck out  when you gave me props for my awesome jokes in the briefing room. Everybody else had their heads so far up their ass. Even my own grandson is like, Oh, the Vindicators are so cool. I mean, hes a moron, its their... demographic. But youre different, Noob-Noob."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,...Motherfucker
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Drunk Rick,"Youre fucking cool And youre smart And I bet we coulda hung out and shit And I hope you get to be a full-fledged Vindicator A-And d-do me a favor. Do-Dont let him know I... I got emotional. But you can tell him one thing. Tell him I said... Oh, fuck. Okay, I just shit myself. Okay, later."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"W--Dude, Morty, what happened i..."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Shut up.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,I sense this means we are not drying.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Not all of us.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Sweetheart
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Just let Titty-Bean do this, Snuzzles. Its for the greater good."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Greater good
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Titty-Bean
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Its like you said, Morty"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Never said that
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Its the galaxys faith in the Vindicators that keeps the galaxy secure
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Yeah, I feel safer already."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,No doubt. Who do we make the check out to
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Ill say, we are gettin some good licks in while choking to death."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,Right
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,"Titty-Bean, listen to me. When you came to me, I was merely a sentient colony of ants. It was your beliefs, your pursuit of justice, that taught me to be a man."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,When did it get so complicated
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Million Ants,Who knows But we can make it simple again.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,You were always the romantic.  Which is why you cant leave either.
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,"Goodbye, my love."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Damn She double-crossed Snuzzles
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Supernova,Silence Im going to enjoy this...
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Announcer,"Lets give a huge thanks to Rick Sanchez for killing Worldender, putting this awesome party together, and for booking one of the hottest talents out there"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Look at that. Geez, I mustve planned a whole party. Invited a bunch of people. Not bad, Drunk Rick, not bad."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Rick, Supernovas getting away"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Ah, who cares"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,But.. she was trying to kill us
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Morty, twenty people try to kill me every week. I end up getting high with half of em. I mean, check it out, Gear Heads here."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Beth,"Morty, youre wearing a Vindicator jacket. Are you a little superhero now"
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Morty,"Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom. Which is why we dont need jackets.  And Im pretty sure we dont need Vindicators."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Summer,"Man, Grandpa Rick must have gotten shitfaced."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,"Shut up, Summer."
3,4,Vindicators 3  The Return of Worldender,Rick,Who the fuck is Noob-Noob
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Rick,"Alright, Morty. You ready for our adventure to the lost city of Atlantis"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,"Ready as Ill ever be, Rick"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Rick,"Oh, for fucks sake."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Rick,"What are you, stupid Were done with the Citadel of Ricks. I was  never on board with it in the first place, thats why I murdered everyone in charge and left it to rot."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,They tried to murder him first.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,"Yeah, he knows. He murdered them."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Rick,Every day.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Rick,You dont have to be a dick.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,Geez. I didnt know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Rick,"Well, you can keep wondering that while we go on our fun, fresh, self-contained adventure to Atlantis.  Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid, or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,Man. Glad Im not one of them
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,"Sixteen iterations off the central finite curve, theres a Rick that works more with wood than polarity plating."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,"His name is Simple Rick, but hes no dummy."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,He realized long ago that the greatest thing hed ever create was his daughter.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,We captured that moment and run it on a loop through Simple Ricks mind.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,And the chemical that makes his brain secrete goes into every Simple Ricks Simple Wafer Cookie.  Come home to the impossible flavor of your own completion. Come home to Simple Ricks.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,"We had a good run, sir, but I think its time to pull out of the race."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,I feel pretty confident about tonights debate.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,"You shouldnt, sir. You should be terrified."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,"Maybe you should find a little faith, young man."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,You dont pay me to have faith And were the same age
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"Oh S-sorry, I was expecting--"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"A Rick partner Lesson one, rookie"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,Mortys are human
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Get the fuck off the car, you Rickless fuckin animal"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Morty,WHOA
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,The elections got these yellow shirts more riled up than a Picture Day Jessica.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"Thats pretty harsh, sir."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,So report me. Nobody gives a fuck.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"Look, Im just saying. Makes me a little sad to hear a Morty cop calling Mortys animals."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Well, it makes me sad to see another Rick cop buying into his sensitivity training."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"Well, Im glad to know theres more like me."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Oh, there was one. Why do you think that seat was empty"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,Fifth and  Thats Mortytown.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,Unit 7 responding.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher Rick,"Good idea, Rick."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher Rick,This is a great adventure.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher Rick,I love being your new Morty.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,Farty
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher Rick,"Very amusing, Mr. Smith. Almost as amusing as when your first Rick was decapitated on Zorpathion 9.  Or was that your third Rick How many Ricks have you had"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,Five
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher Rick,"I see. So you are top of the class in something.  Tomorrow you will be transferred to your new Ricks. Hopefully, they will be your last. Yes, Slow Ri-- Tall Morty"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Teacher Rick,"Anythings possible, Tall Morty. Ugh"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,"Guess we wont be seein each other after this, huh"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,I say we make our last day count. I say we go to the Wishing Portal.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Morty,Thats a myth.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,"If were not here for graduation, our butts are gonna end up in Mortytown."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,"I thought your last Rick fused you with a lizard, not a chicken."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,"Okay, fine. Im in."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Morty,Me too.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,I-I thought I saw a fly.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"No Ricks, no families, high off their asses and runnin amok. Mortys are raised to be sidekicks. Without a side to kick, they just start kickin."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Yeah, make sure you get that down."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"Any mutations Augmentations Three eyes, a tail, maybe a buzzcut"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,Lemme turn over a few rocks.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Aw geez, hey, whats goin on, fellas"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Morty 1,"Aw geez, man, nothin man, were just hangin out and stuff."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"I hear that, ah geez, I guess Im supposed to be figuring out who robbed the store across the street but aw geez I dunno."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Morty 2,"Ah geez man, that sucks that your Ricks makin you do that."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Hes not my Rick. Hes my partner. Aw, geez."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Morty 1,"Well, maybe the uniform makes a big difference. Who am I to say To me, you just look like a sidekick."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,CALL ME A SIDEKICK ONE MORE TIME CALL ME A SIDEKICK
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Morty 2,"Hey man Cmon, aw geez"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,WANNA SEE HOW I PAINT A WALL
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Morty 2,"It was the Mortytown Locos, man The Mortytown Locos"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,Do you realize how many codes you just violated
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Aw geez, Rick. What do I know about knowin stuff Get in the fucking car."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,"Can we fact-check this, please Never mind, who am I kidding This race is over."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,I dont see a divide between Ricks and Mortys.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,"You guys finished  The division I see is between the Ricks and Mortys that like the Citadel divided, and the rest of us. I see it everywhere I go."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,"I see it in our schools, where they teach Mortys were all the same because theyre threatened by what makes us unique."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,"I see it in our streets, where they give guns to Mortys so were too busy fighting each other to fight real injustice."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,"I see it in our factories, where Ricks work for a fraction of their bosss salary, even though theyre identical and have the same IQ. The Citadels problem isnt homeless Mortys or outraged Ricks."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,The Citadels problem is the Ricks and Mortys feeding on the Citadels debt.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Rick J-22,Holy shit.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,"But Ive got a message for them, from the Ricks and Mortys keeping it alive. A message from the Ricks and Mortys that believe in this Citadel to the Ricks and Mortys that dont"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,Holy shit.  I dont believe it I-I cant believe it
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,I know.  Thats why youre fired.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Rick J-22,"Your life is a lie, man.  All your lives are lies Dont you get it They told us we were special because we were Ricks, but they stripped us of anything that made us unique"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Rick J-22,"I-I-I want a portal gun. Unregistered, untraceable, with enough fluid to take me off this goddamn prison"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,Yes
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,Gosh. We moved around so much its hard to remember. I see every Rick as my Rick.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,I hope they see me as their Morty.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,"Another, please, with less water."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,I guess I shoulda had more faith.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,Whats this
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,Hands in the air
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,You guys doin a little chemistry homework with Grandpa
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,Is this what I think it is
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,Bootleg portal fluid.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,Guess his math was off. Search the place.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"Its okay, Morty."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,Jesus
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"He stabbed me He got me bad, Morty."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Shh, its okay, youre okay."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,You were right  Everything I learned in the academy was--
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,It doesnt matter.  Nothings wrong with putting your faith in a Morty. You just gotta pick the right one.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,Why is there a crib in here
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,Just somethin they do to make you feel bad.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"Boy, I got us knee-deep in paperwork, huh"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,Go to the car and grab a MediPack. Lemme worry about this.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,What happened
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,Same old story. Mortys killing Mortys.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,Almost... got it...
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,I bet it leads to a place where a bunch of fri-- flies everywhere
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,"Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere. I bet its a big hole where the Citadel dumps all its broken dreams."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,"You wanna know why  Because of this Im part of an experimental line of Mortys with a trauma implant. How do you think it feels, Fat Morty, to know that no matter where I go,  Ill always be the one that makes everybody sad and... a little bored"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Morty,"Slick, that implant isnt who you are, okay You also roll up your sleeves."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,Then you should use your left hand to eat more vegetables.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,Hey there. How you doing Great to meet you.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Candidate Morty,"That doesnt sound like Rick work. You didnt come to the Citadel to be a plumber, did you"

3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,The Creepy Morty. What is it your kinds always saying Dont think about it. Come on. Theres someone important I want you to meet.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,They had a little accident. They wont be causing any trouble anymore.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Big Morty likes to contribute to keeping the peace in Mortytown.  Think of him as a drug lord, and us his cops on his payroll."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,Morty...
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"M-m-my partner. Morty, youre right. Mortytown is bad, but that doesnt mean that we have to be."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Dont worry about Rick, Big Morty. Hes new. He doesnt understand how it works."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Wh-why would you say something like that, Big Morty Youre fucking things up for both of us here"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"Big Morty, youre under arrest."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,S-smartest man in the universe.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Not so big now, are ya"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,Thats enough
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"If we dont kill him, hell talk"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"If you do, Ill talk."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,"You told me to put my faith in the right Morty. I got faith in you, partner. Do the right thing."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Morty,"Oh, Grandpa Rick I dont wanna be on the Citadel anymore I want to be a regular kid I want to go to school and throw balls around and masturbate"
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Cop Rick,Same old story. Ricks killing Mortys.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Rick J-22,"A bad place, but youre going to a better one soon."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Rick J-22,A portal to the Blender Dimension Thats the oldest trick in the book Im a Rick Im more Rick than any of you
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Rick J-22,"Then come and get me, motherfuckers"

3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Rick J-22,Where are we going
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,"Theres a Rick who held a factory hostage after murdering his boss and several co-workers. The factory made cookies, flavored him with lies."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,"He made us all take a look at what we were doing, and at the bargain he got a taste of real freedom."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Narrator,"We captured that taste, and we keep giving it to him so he can give it right back to you, in every bite of new Simple Rick Freedom Wafer Selects.  Come home to the unique flavor of shattering the grand illusion. Come home to Simple Rick."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,After you.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,I guess I wish I had something cooler than this dumbass surfer necklace.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Morty,"I wish incest porn h-had a more mainstream appeal, f-for a friend of mine."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,"None of those things are gonna happen, yknow. Morty wishes never come true. Not on the Citadel."
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Lizard Morty,Then why did you bring us here
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Slick,Because I wish that would change. I wish anything about this life would change.
3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Glasses Morty,"Well, I hope youre putting something pretty goddamn important in there."

3,7,Tales From the Citadel,Campaign Manager Morty,"Hes alive No, no, no You gotta listen to me  I-I worked for him I was his campaign manager That Morty is not what he seems."
